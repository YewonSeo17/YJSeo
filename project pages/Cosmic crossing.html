            <h1>Cosmic crossing</h1>
            <h3>Sep 15, 2023</h3>
            <p>The title “Cosmic crossing” means the horizon where the ocean meets the sky. Co-workers and I designed the structure to show the process of take-off and landing that astronauts experience in their every flight. While visitors climb stairs, they observe the concrete mass that gradually turns into the horizon. It represents the landing of a spaceship. Meanwhile, after getting out of the concrete walls, visitors climb the ramp to the park and resist gravity. This cosmic experience harmonizes with visitors and makes a unique impression. In addition, it offers an opportunity to learn the history of space science.</p>
