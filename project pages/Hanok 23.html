            <h1>HanOk 23</h1>
            <h3>Oct 28, 2023</h3>
            <p>HanOk is a traditional Korean housing, well known for its adiabatic advantages. While it is cool in summer due to its structure allowing a breeze to pass through the entire house, it also stays warm in winter by capturing heat with its unique floor heating system called Ondol. According to the principle of convection current, warm air flows upward while cold air sinks downward. Using this mechanism, Ondol heats air near the floor with hot smoke coming from the furnace. Heated air goes upward, warming up the entire air in the room, and sinks after cooled down, reheated by the warm floor.</p>
            <p>In our daily lives, we often prioritize convenience and overlook the importance of tradition. With this artwork created using SketchUp Free and D5 Render, I aimed to celebrate tradition and blend it with modernity. The initial inspiration for the modeling came from Gyeongbokgung Palace in South Korea.</p>
