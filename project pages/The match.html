            <h1>The match</h1>
            <h3>Jan 15, 2024</h3>
            <p>Matches mean a fresh start, a new dawn for me. At the very beginning of the ignition, the match flares brightly with a staccato burst, symbolizing the tiny yet gigantic launch. The mechanism of lighting a match is simple. When the head of a match and the mixture of red phosphorus and glass pieces rub together, a minuscule amount of white phosphorus is formed and catches on fire. It is the same to start something. Even though it may seem basic, something occurs only when distinct conditions are satisfied.</p>
            <p>In the past, matches were an invention that made our lives prosperous. However, now they gave way to high technologies and have become elusive. Through a series of photographs and paintings, I tried to reflect on the cultural significance of matches. The most unique feature of matches is that they burn brightest at the moment of ignition and then quickly extinguish. Videos and photos capture the single-shot nature of the match and the intensity of blazing briefly but fiercely.</p>
