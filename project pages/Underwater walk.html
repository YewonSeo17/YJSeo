            <p>Disabled individuals, especially those who use wheelchairs, are particularly vulnerable to fire accidents. When a building is set on fire, people inside must immediately escape the building using the stairs. However, disabled individuals, the elderly, and children who are unable to navigate the path on their own often encounter difficulties while trying to escape. Additionally, in emergencies, it is not possible to use elevators or escalators. Research shows that elderly individuals and people with disabilities are less likely to survive in such disastrous situations.</p>
            <p>To address this problem, my co-workers and I have designed a structure called the "Underwater Walk". This structure provides an alternative means of escape from the building without relying on stairs or elevators. The path is connected to each floor of the building. Long ramps offer people an additional route to safety during disasters. People can also use ramps as walking tracks, and LED signage displays will enhance the joy of walking through them.</p>
